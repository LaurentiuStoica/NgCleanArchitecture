# Angular Clean Architecture POC

This document outlines the structure and design principles for building a Proof of Concept (POC) using Angular and Clean Architecture. The focus is on establishing a scalable, testable, and maintainable application architecture.

## Goals
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure clear division of responsibilities across layers.
- **Scalability**: Provide a foundation that can grow with application requirements.
- **Testability**: Enable isolated testing of business logic and UI components.

## Architecture Layers
### 1. **Core/Domain Layer**
The core layer encapsulates the business logic and domain models. It is independent of frameworks or external dependencies.

- **Entities**: Represent the core business models.
- **Use Cases**: Define application-specific business logic.

### 2. **Application Layer**
The application layer is responsible for orchestrating the application-specific workflows. It interacts with the core layer and provides abstractions for the presentation layer.

- **Facades**: Simplify access to use cases and manage state.

### 3. **Infrastructure Layer**
The infrastructure layer deals with external dependencies such as APIs, data storage, and third-party services.

- **Services**: Handle communication with APIs or external systems.

### 4. **Presentation Layer**
The presentation layer is responsible for the user interface and routes.

- **Components**: Render UI elements and handle user interactions.
- **Routing**: Define navigation paths.

## Folder Structure
```plaintext
src/
├── app/
│   ├── core/               # Core layer: entities, use cases, and interfaces
│   ├── application/        # Application layer: facades, state management
│   ├── infrastructure/     # Infrastructure layer: API calls, external dependencies
│   ├── presentation/       # Presentation layer: components, routes, UI
│   ├── shared/             # Shared utilities, common components, directives
```

## Key Principles
- **Dependency Rule**: Each layer depends only on the layer directly below it.
- **Encapsulation**: Business logic and UI concerns are isolated in respective layers.
- **Reusability**: Code is modular and reusable.

## Angular Compatibility
This architecture is designed to be compatible with the latest Angular version. Consider leveraging new features such as standalone components and Signal APIs for optimal performance and maintainability.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Angular CLI installed (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Steps
1. Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
2. Generate modules for each layer: core, application, infrastructure, and presentation.
3. Define the folder structure and create initial files for each layer.
4. Set up routing and initial components in the presentation layer.
5. Implement basic facades, use cases, and services to connect the layers.

## Future Enhancements
- **State Management**: Integrate NgRx or another state management library if needed.
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Implement incremental hydration for improved performance.
- **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for all layers.
